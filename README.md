# Ubuntu-Debian-Wifi-Card-Reboot
Bash script to stop and restart a misbehaving Intel 7620 wifi PCI card on Ubuntu and Debian based Linux distros 

ifconfig is required on your system to successfully run this script. If you don't have it:

```sudo apt install net-tools```

Just clone or copy the script and run it. File permissions and script aliasing is up to you, running the script directly with sudo should be fine.
